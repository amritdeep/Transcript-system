Transcript-system
=================

 Our goal is to build a transcript system for a university, such as the one below:            Name:  John Doe          Id:  123-456-789         GPA :  3.63          Major:  Computer Science          Winter 2013                  Math 1C             B+                   Comp Sci 100    A                  Comp Sci 111    A-          Fall 2012                   Math 1B             B                  English 1            A                   Comp Sci 2        A-          Spring 2012                   Math 1A             A-                  History 10          B+                   Comp Sci 1        A  For this transcript system do the following four things. If you are unable to do all five, do whichever you are capable of solving, though we will assume that you are unable to solve any part that you leave blank: (a) Design a SQL Schema to store the data above (b) Write the SQL Queries to get the data above from the database using the schema you design in A (c) Write the HTML code to display the page above (d)  Write the CSS to display items as formatted above (e.g. bold, underline,  white space /indenting, italics, etc) (e) Write Javascript code so that after the page finishes loading, the GPA is dynamically calculated from the grades and displayed within the transcript.
